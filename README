VIEWER    EXE - Command line viewer for many file formats

=============
Some features
=============

1.  The NOMSSI Viewer is a SuperVGA specialist, your machine configuration
    is autodetected, available resources are used, the VGA chipset families

      Acumos, Ahead, ATI, Avance Logic, Chips&Tech, Cirrus, Compaq,
      Everex, Genoa, HMC, MXIC, MGA, NCR, Oak, Paradise, Poach, PRIMUS,
      Realtek, S3, Trident, Tseng, UMC, Video7, Weitek, Yamaha

    and the VESA BIOS extensions are supported (about 180 unique chipsets).
    The video memory, the available 8, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits video mode
    (256 color, 32K or 64K HiColor and 16M TrueColor) are detected and used.
    The NOMSSI Viewer can use the whole video card memory and control the
    VGA hardware for *real-time* scrolling of images, even with the mouse.
    An available 32x32 hardware cursor is used.

2.  The NOMSSI Viewer supports eight graphics file formats with most of their
    particular extensions, including OS/2 Bitmap arrays, IFF HAM coding and
    PBM FORMs, PCX CGA/EGA images, PNG alpha chanel, gamma correction and
    many TIFF extensions (planar, tiled, CMYK, YCbCr images, extra samples).

3.  Graphics are buffered on multiple media at a time, extra memory like
    UMB, EMS, XMS or disk space is used as image buffer and for overlay
    management. With this, you can pan over very large images in any video
    mode and do simple image transformations (flip, mirror, rotate, center,
    shrink, zoom) and color editing (brightness, contrast, gamma correction,
    grayscale).

4.  The NOMSSI Viewer is accurate: specify the monitor gamma and select one
    of six different algorithms to reduce the color depth of a given image
    (maximum number of unique colors in the image) with minimal degradation
    of the image quality.
    Fast-but-inaccurate dithering methods are offered as well as slower
    and/or resource intensive two-pass quantization methods with excellent
    visual quality.

5.  The NOMSSI Viewer does slideshows and creates catalogs (image indexes),
    up to 81 (9x9) images are displayed simultaneously in any supported
    graphics mode. The file ordering, the video mode, the delay between
    images, the catalog layout are user-defined.
    Select a group of files and view them in turn as a slideshow.
    Pause on any image, edit the image, resume the slideshow, return to
    previous images, save the pictures as palette color files in the
    BMP, GIF, TGA or TIFF formats.

6.  The user interface is event-oriented, with mouse support, pull-down
    menus, context sensitive help (english and german help texts), a
    unique 'screen saver' (please don't panic, it is neither a virus nor
    a bug), file manager with sort, copy, rename, delete, find functions,
    text and binary browser, execute function for .EXE, .COM and .BAT files.
    All file dialogs (file load, file finder, directory tree) are non-modal,
    multiple instances can  coexist.  All parameters are customized at run-
    time in dialog. Changes take effect immediatly, with no need to restart.

7.  The NOMSSI Viewer environment integrates third-party components. The
    tools editor and the association editor allow to add new functions even
    at run-time. Mark Stehr's viewer (special edition) with .FLI/.FLC, .ICO
    and PhotoCD support demonstrates this feature:
      o Install up to 15 external applications in the User menu, with help
        text and hotkey, and/or
      o Associate a class of data-files to any external application.
        The NOMSSI Viewer seamlessly launches the linked application to
        handle associated data-files.

8.  The command line is processed at startup with all path names, files,
    file masks and slideshow script files specified. The NOMSSI Viewer also
    possesses an event recorder with the ability to save every user action
    during a session and auto-replay the whole session later.

============================
Setting up The NOMSSI Viewer
============================
1. Create a target directory for The NOMSSI Viewer on your hard drive.
   REMOVE THE OLD CONFIGURATION FILE NV.CFG from the target directory
   prior to any update from a previous release.

2. Set the environment variable TEMP to a list of directories with enough
   free disk space for temporary files (e.g. insert

   SET TEMP=C:\TEMP;D:\

   in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and reboot to let the changes take effect). The
   current directory is used if this variable does not exist.

3. PKUNZIP ver 2.04g or higher is needed to unpack the original archive,
   a .ZIP file. Copy all files to the target directory on your hard drive.

4. Type NV.EXE at DOS prompt to start The NOMSSI Viewer.

5. Select Option\Display or press F9 to open the display dialog. Verify that
   your machine configuration is correctly reported and that the available
   video modes with 256, 32K, 64K and 16M colors are enabled.

   o  The item "32-bits" is hidden, with only an open bracket "(" on screen.
      (rev. 1.3g-1.4d)
   o  The available native VGA chipset is normally detected, The NOMSSI
      Viewer works with chipset-dependent code for a variety of cards.
      If you experience some problems, install a VESA driver and use the
      /VESA command line parameter, i.e. start The NOMSSI Viewer with

      NV /VESA  (bypass autodection, assumes VESA compliant BIOS)

   o  HiColor and TrueColor are not be used if your DAC is not recognized.
      Try the /DAC command line parameter

      NV /DAC   (assumes you have a TrueColor DAC)

6. Check the "[X] VESA driver" item to force the use of the VESA interface.
   Verify that the available VESA modes are recognized.

   You may have to install a driver to use VESA modes. Check The Universal
   VESA VBE, a stand alone program Copyright 1993 by Kendall Bennett. It is
   available via ftp from the above-mentioned SimTel mirrors as
   /SimTel/msdos/graphics/UVESAxx.ZIP

   The file NV.CFG is automatically written or updated with the current
   settings when you leave the Options\Display dialog.

7. Press Ctrl+F9 to open the Preferences dialog box. Use the TAB and SHIFT+
   TAB keys to navigate through the various items and select your defaults.
   Each option is explained with a short hint in the statusline at the bottom
   of the screen. The F1 key opens a help screen with verbose information
   about the current field. The menu item Options\Save writes your defaults
   to the NV.CFG file.

8. Press Alt+X to exit The NOMSSI Viewer. At this point, you can start The
   NOMSSI Viewer again by keying

   RECORD.BAT test

   You can now load some graphics files, try F1 from graphics mode, test the
   slideshow, install or edit some tools with Option/Tools, use the online
   help system. After exiting again, type in

   PLAY.BAT test

   You will realize you have been shadowed to whole time. Also try

   DEMO.BAT

   Press ESC at any time to abort and Alt+X to exit the demo.

9. You might want to use The NOMSSI Viewer as a shell for any command line
   utility. Create your own association file, using the sample association
   file NV.EXT as a template.
   Use Option\Tools to add and edit tools (e.g. UUdecoder).

============
A quick tour
============
The NOMSSI Viewer is menu-driven and intuitive, you may already be using it.
You communicate with the software using state-of-the-art dialog boxes.
Dialogs are mostly non-modal, you can open several dialogs and switch between
them without closing or canceling. Some operations can even be performed
concurrently in different dialogs, e.g. loading a image while scanning the
whole drive for graphics files.

Each dialog box is a tool with a given functionality, you decide which one
to use for a given operation. There are currently three file dialogs, that
can be used for graphics display. The standard ``Load an image file'' dialog
is the most powerfull, it combines the ease of use of a file list with the
power of a command line. It also offers slideshow and catalog options.
You might also want to use the directory tree (Shift+F3 or Windows\Directory)
to navigate through a whole drive or the File\Search dialog to recursively
scan a directory subtree for graphics file.

Press F3 to open a new "Load an image file" dialog box. Locate graphics file
on disk and press Enter or click the Load-button to load and display the
selected file. Press SHIFT+Enter to browse a text file or CTRL+Enter to
display an hex-dump of the file. Executable files with .EXE, .BAT or .COM
extension are started with optional parameters.

Press the space bar or click the name with the right mouse button to add or
remove the currently selected (highliten) file to the group of tagged files.
The tag character "û" appears. The File\Group select-menu allows to select
files using a file mask.

File operations like copy, erase or slideshow are automatically disabled
whenever no file or group of files is selected in the current file dialog.
The slideshow button is disabled at startup and automatically enabled as
soon as at least two files are selected. Press F8 or click on this button
to setup the slideshow parameters and start a slideshow of the selected
group of file.

Control over the running slideshow even with the mouse: the images are
displayed exactly in the selection order, the current image is selected when
you cancel the slideshow, reverse the sequence of slides with TAB, click once
on the right mouse button or press the space bar to freeze the slideshow on
any image. You can still use the image editing tools. Press Enter or click
the left mouse button to resume or click the right mouse button again or
press ESC to cancel. Backspace returns to the previous image. A slideshow
from a script file with individually timed graphics file is possible.

The NOMSSI Viewer checks the association list (File\Association menu) and
launches the associated application if the file format is not recognized.
Otherwise the "Reading" message box pops up, providing image informations
while the graphics file is decoded to a buffer.
Thereafter, a graphics mode is initialized and the image is displayed.

While viewing the image, you dispose about a few but powerfull tools to edit
the brightness and contrast, scale, flip or pan trough the image and save it
to a new graphics file. Press F1 for a help screen, load and display the
next file in the file list with Enter, ESC cancel the viewing.

The help system provides online information for almost all topics. Check
the statusline for a short, context-sensitive hint. Press the F1 key or click
the Help field in the statusline at any time to open a help screen, with a
description of the current context. Help screens contain hypertext links to
other topics.

=======================
Command line parameters
=======================
The NOMSSI Viewer handles command line parameter of five types in any order:

1) Graphics file names
   All files in the active directory that matches the file mask are loaded
   and displayed. The following example starts The NOMSSI Viewer and displays
   the two files in turn

   C:\NV>NV C:\PCXLIST\image1.pcx C:\PCXLIST\image2.pcx

   (assumes The NOMSSI Viewer to be installed in the C:\NV\ directory).
   All slideshow commands except "reverse slide order" can be used. The
   current display and slideshow options are read from the configuration file
   NV.CFG. Note that an image will only stay on screen for 25s(default value)
   if you don't pause the slideshow with the space bar.

2) Directory names (paths)
   Relative paths are allowed. You may first specify a path, so the
   subsequent file names in the list will not need to be complete with path.

   C:\NV>NV C:\IMAGES\TIF\*.* - displays all graphics files in C:\IMAGES\TIF\

   C:\NV>NV .                 - force the current directory to be used at
                                startup, overwrites the default.
3) The /Q switch
   forces The NOMSSI Viewer to exit after the last command line parameter is
   processed. This command is stated in a slideshow script file as :QUIT.

   C:\NV>NV NVIEW.GIF VGALOGO.RLE /Q  - shows the graphics files and exit.

4) Slideshow script files
   Script file are specified with the leading '@' character. Check the
   current list of script file commands in the sample LOGOS.SLD script file.
   The delay time can be specified individualy for each file in seconds.

   C:\NV>NV *.TGA /Q C:\IMAGES\NVIEW\ N*.TIF @NVLOGOS.SLD

   Actions: display all .TGA files in the current directory, select the
   directory C:\IMAGES\NVIEW\, display all .TIF files starting with N in
   this directory, run the slideshow script file NVLOGOS.SLD and exit.

5) The /VESA switch
   bypasses the VGA chipset autodetection and use the VESA BIOS Extension
   (VBE) if available. Use this switch if you have weird problems with the
   standard autodetection (i.e. your machine hang, or the display is
   corrupted).

=====================
Graphics file formats
=====================
A graphics file format defines a standard that most graphics programs and
filters can use for storing graphics information. The internal arrangement
of the data within the graphics file and a specific color representation
is defined, the image data can be represented correctly in a permanent form.
Color information can be represented in several color spaces, the
most popular is the RGB (Reg-Green-Blue) space.

One subdividde raster images in in bi-level, grayscale, palette-color and
full-color (TrueColor) images to accomodate the different capabilities of
output devices.
Application specific image data storage is often optimized for loading speed
in a special hardware configuration. Images for for use in different
applications and/or on different computer platforms must follow a standard,
portable file format specification.
Image compression reduces the storage requirements of pictorial data and the
time required for access to and transmission of an image. Lossy compression
gives up some of the image quality to achieve very high compression ratios.

The NOMSSI Viewer supports the following raster image file formats with most
of their particular extensions:

1) Windows and OS/2 Device-Independent Bitmaps DIB

Bitmaps are used under Windows 3.x and OS/2 to store bi-level, palette color
and full color images (1,4,8 and 24 bits/pixel). The NOMSSI Viewer reads both
uncompressed .BMP and compressed .RLE (4 bits and 8 bits RLE) bitmap files.
OS/2 2.x bitmaps may include several pictures, which are shown in turn.

The NOMSSI Viewer writes uncompressed, palette color Windows 3.x BMP files
with 8 bits/pixel.

2) Compuserve Inc. Graphics Interchange Format GIF

GIF files are widely used for image data transmission, because of the
smaller file size. The format specification limits the number of colors/
pixel to 256, selectable from a wider palette. The GIF89a specification
allows GIF files to store text and commands for animations.
The NOMSSI Viewer ignores some GIF89a extensions like comments and pauses,
but supports multi-images GIF files.

Compatibility: The NOMSSI Viewer writes GIF89a graphics file with a local
color map. Older releases (prior 1.2c) are unable to handle these valid
image files.

3) Portable Network Graphics PNG (pronounce: PiNG)

A patent owner of the LZW compression algorithm used in GIF enforces
it for all for-profit software written or enhanced after Dec. 1994.
PNG was created 1995 to offer a legally unencumbered standard graphics
format to the network community. PNG supports grayscale, palette color
and TrueColor images, with an optional transparency informations.
PNG is streamable, PNG has progressive display capability, and the PNG
adaptative filters lead to better compression of the image data.

The NOMSSI Viewer reads PNG files compliant to the 9th draft.
PNG files are not created yet.

4) Truevision TGA file format

The TGA file format was the first TrueColor file format widely available.
The current TGA file specification defines the TGA file types 1,2,3, 9,10
and 11 (color mapped, TrueColor and grayscale uncompressed and run-length
encoded files).
The NOMSSI Viewer reads all these file types, right-to-left data ordering
is assumed. The ".TGA" suffix should be the only one used.

The NOMSSI Viewer writes color-mapped (type 1) TGA files with 32 bits/color
map entry and 8 bits/pixel. The pixel data ordering is left-to-right and
bottom-to-top.

5) Adlus tag-based file format TIFF

TIFF is a file format for storing and interchanging bi-level, grayscale,
palette-color and full color raster image data in several color spaces.
TIFF is tag-based and designed to be extensible. It is a rich format,
that allow to the image itself, i.e. information for document storage and
retriaval, informations about the capabilities of the imaging devices.

The NOMSSI Viewer supports the current Baseline TIFF 6.0 definition and
many, many TIFF 6.0 Extensions (CCITT 1D and LZW Compression, tiled, planar,
YCbCr, CMYK/seperated images, extra samples).
Not supported are:
  o  LZW strips/tiles with more than 65527 bytes
  o  TIFF FAX G4
  o  TIFF/JPEG compression
Pixel data ordering other as left-to-right and top-to-bottom are ignored.

The NOMSSI Viewer writes palette-color TIFF files.

6) ZSoft PC Paintbrush Format PCX

The PCX image file format is in widespread use on the PC. The NOMSSI Viewer
handles PCX-files with 1..8 and 24 bits per pixel. Some 256 color PCX files
are written without color map table, a grayscale map is assumed.
Pictures with 2 or 4 colors are displayed using the CGA color map. SHIFT+F9
switchs to the standard EGA color map, which is sometimes assumed.

7) The Interchange File Format IFF

IFF is a file format for storing and interchanging data (text, images, music
and more). It is in widespread use on the Amiga. IFF stores data in so-called
FORMs. The NOMSSI Viewer reads IFF ILBM (Interleaved Bitmap) with 1..8 and
24 bits/pixel and PBM (Packed Bitmap) forms, which contains image data,
offering support for run-length and HAM encoding.

8) JPEG File Interchange Format

The Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) has created an international
standard for saving continuous-tone still images in a compressed format.
The baseline JPEG process is lossy, it gives up some image quality to
achieve very high compression ratios, i.e. smaller file size.

The JPEG standard does not specify a graphics file format, it defines the
JPEG Interchange Format.
The JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) is a minimal file format which
enables JPEG bitstreams to be exchanged between a wide variety of platforms
and applications. JFIF is entirely compatible with the standard JPEG
interchange format, it uses the YCbCr color space.

The JPEG decoding routines require a PC with 80386SX processor or better.
The maximum image width is 4000 pixel.

==========================
Advanced User Informations
==========================
1. Panning

  The NOMSSI Viewer can use hardware and software panning (Option\Preferences
  \Hardware scroll). Hardware panning is extremly fast, even on the slowest
  machines. The image is truncated if it does not fit in the available video
  memory.
  Software scrolling does not have this size limitation, image tiles are
  reloaded from the buffer medium (Memory, EMS, XMS or disk). Note that the
  scrolling loading from disk is usually slow.
  Note(1.3i): The scrolling is slower when two pass quantization
              methods are used (Median-Cut, Octree or Neural-net).

2. Quantization

  The extended SuperVGA modes with 24 bits/pixel (16,777,216 colors) provide
  the best representation of a color image for human eyes, they are refered
  to as "TrueColor" modes. These modes consume excessive space (3 bytes of
  storage per pixel) and require large and expensive video memory. Many
  SuperVGA can display only in 8 bits/pixels modes, the color values in the
  video memory are used as indexes in a look-up table (LUT) to select the
  real RGB data. With that, one have 256 distinct colors for each picture at
  disposal, which can be selected from a much larger palette. To display an
  image with more colors than the current display capabilities, one either
  uses dithering or color quantization or both.

  Dithering is the use of more than one pixel to represent a color value,
  giving up some spatial resolution. Our visual system performs spatial
  integration (averages) if we view a small area from a sufficiently large
  distance. Dithering is fairly fast and produces quite good looking color
  images in high resolution video modes.
  A dithered image seems to contains noise in low resolution modes or on
  enlarged images. It will not compress very well.

  Color quantization reduces the number of unique colors of an image with
  minimal degradation of the image quality. One must first select the best
  representative table of colors for the given image. Each pixel is then
  replaced with the most similar color in the table. The image colors can
  then be coded with table indexes, lowering the storage requirement.

  The NOMSSI Viewer offers a palette of quantization methods with different
  quality/speed ratios (Options\Display\Quantization).

  o  Grayscale         The luminance component is used to control the
                       grayshade (for JPEG images only).

  o  Pattern dithering A 2x2 dither matrix (magic square) is used for Red and
                       Green, a 4x4 matrix is used for Blue.

  o  Floyd-Steinberg   This error diffusion scheme distribute the dithering
                       error made on the the current pixel over its neighbors.

  o  Median-Cut        This method builds a 3D-histogram and use it to
                       subdivise the image color space in subboxes, allowing
                       to accurately select 256 best representative colors
                       for a given image.
                       The NOMSSI Viewer uses Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion
                       in the second pass, while mapping RGB colors to the
                       most similar palette colors.

  o  Oct-tree          This method uses oct-trees to recursively divise the
                       RGB-cube, using normally less memory than a 3D-
                       histogram.
                       Dithering is not used, the obtained images will
                       compress better.

  o  Neural-network    This method compute the optimal palette for a given
                       image using a Kohonen neural net with a learning
                       phase. Flyod-Steinberg dithering step is performed in
                       the second pass if enough memory is available.
                       The neural net quantization item cannot be selected
                       with the mouse.

3. Video mode selection algorithm

  With "Options\Display\Mode auto" checked, The NOMSSI Viewer uses the
  currently selected color depth (Options\Display\Colors) as the maximal
  value and seeks the video mode with the lowest available color depth, that
  still provides enough colors for the image.
  This means a GIF file (256 colors) will not be loaded in a TrueColor mode
  if a 256 color mode is available, even if the 24 bits/pixel color depth is
  selected.

4. Gamma correction

  The purpose of gamma correction is the compensation of the artefacts
  introduced by your output device, that is, your monitor. This lets
  color images appear identical on different output devices.
  Gamma correction is usually used to lighten the mid-tones in images from
  scanners. Press Alt+F9 to switch to the monitor or the user-defined gamma.

  Notes:
   o  Gamma-correction does not work in HiColor modes.
   o  The exponential transfer function used is not accurate for
      color LCD displays.
   o  All three RGB components use the same correction curve.

5. Graphics mode tools

  While an image is displayed, press F1 for a help screen. The NOMSSI Viewer
  switchs to a text mode without clearing the video memory, and the available
  keyboard controls are displayed. These are powerfull one-touch commands,
  check the summary in "keyboard commands" below.

6. Event Recorder

  The NOMSSI Viewer can save every single action of yours in a file and later
  *automagically* replay it. Start the DEMO.BAT file as an example for this
  unique feature.
  The NOMSSI Viewer uses the environment variables "listen" and "play" to
  control recording/playback, the RECORD.BAT and PLAY.BAT files are ready-
  to-use batch files for this purpose.

7. Association Editor

  Define and edit links between data files and the appropriate applications
  using the Association Editor (File\Associate). Select a valid file name in
  the file list box (dialog box "Load an image file") or this menu item will
  be disabled. The sample NV.EXT file shows how to specify associations from
  a text file.

  Data files are recognized by the file name extension, like .VOC, .WAV or
  .MOD for sound files. The associated applications are specified using a
  command line with the complete path and other extra parameters. Do not
  forget the file name extension (I often do).

     Extension  Command line

     .TXT       COMMAND.COM /C TYPE
     .MPG       C:\GO32.EXE D:\IMAGES\VIDEO\VMPEG
     .MOD       D:\MISCELL\MUSIC\PLAY.EXE
     .FLI       VIEWER.EXE -s4
     .VOC       VOCPLAY.EXE
     .ANS       FASTANSI.EXE

  Trying to load an "associated" data file (i.e. a text file or a sound file)
  will automatically start the linked application. Therefore you can edit a
  text file or play back a sample from within The NOMSSI Viewer. The user-
  defined command line is used to start the application seamlessly, handing
  over the data file as the last command line parameter. DOS Error codes
  are reported if Option\Preferences\Confirmations is checked.

8. User installed tools

  Add new features yourself, install your own utilities using the "Tools"
  dialog, from the Options\Tools menu. You can define new tools or edit
  an existing one. State the DOS command line, assign a hotkey to your tool,
  enter a one-line description for the statusline, enter a title for the
  "User" menu. The tilde ~ can be used to highlight a  character, i.e.

  ~V~iewer  is displayed with a lit V.

  User installed tools are integrated in The NOMSSI Viewer environment. They
  are started from the user menu or with their hotkey. The current file name
  can be passed as parameter.

9. Slideshow and Catalogs

  The slideshow button in the "Load an image file" dialog is enabled if at
  least two file from the file list have been selected. Catalogs are often
  refered to as thumbnails, indexes. We call them "image array". To build
  an image array, check the "Arrange to an array" box and enter a page
  layout in the "Layout" input line. Up to 81 (9x9) images can be displayed
  in a catalog, the layout is not restricted to the square numbers (i.e. 1x5,
  3x2, 1x1 images can be specified).

  The NOMSSI Viewer normally creates catalogs on-the-fly, the images are
  converted to a standard palette and displayed reduced on screen.
  Particulary, 1x1 catalogs may be used to convert a bunch of images to the
  same, standard palette.

  The catalog is saved to disk if "Save completed array" is checked and at
  least one buffer medium is enabled. Best quality catalogs are saved from
  8 bits (256 color) modes. The NOMSSI Viewer first creates a catalog buffer
  and reads a fullscreen of graphics file to the buffer in the first pass.
  A dummy frame with the file name is displayed.
  The image informations are analysed and an optimal palette is computed for
  this page using one of the quantisation methods. This palette is used in
  second pass to display all images.
  This is fairly fast and produces high quality catalogs. A large amount
  of free machine resources are required, namely the buffer space for all
  images and memory for the quantization buffers.

  One pass quantization methods are used to save catalogs in HiColor and
  TrueColor modes. The images look nice onscreen, but fast dithering is
  used to create a palette color graphics file.

  Catalog are saved in the current directory. If Options/Display/Picture
  "Aspect ratio" option is checked, the image is scaled proportionally,
  otherwise it is scaled to fit in the catalog box, regardless of the
  involved distortion.
  If the "Scale down" option is disabled, The NOMSSI Viewer scale all images
  to the catalog box size, regardless of their size. This may be unwanted,
  particulary for tiny images that are enlarged.

  The NOMSSI Viewer pauses after the last image (or first image, if the file
  order was reversed) and after each screenfull of images. The "Save
  completed array" option disables this pause.
  It stops after
  completing all open windows.

  The "Cycle Slideshow" option allows to start an endless slideshow, that
  can even pass midnight. It must be enabled in order to reverse the file
  order with TAB, but it is ineffective is "All open windows" is checked.

  "All open windows" allows to do slideshow in a file/search or directory
  tree window. Select at least two files in the current "Load an image file"
  window, and the slideshow will run with all open windows in turn. You can
  start a slideshow with *all* image files on your harddisk(s), provided
  you have enough memory for all open windows.

  The "Superimpose pictures" option is active when two file are loaded in
  turn by pressing Enter: The screen is not cleared if tagged "Disable Beep"
  stops the beep temporary, while the slideshow is running.

  The file list is re-read after any file saved.

===============
Troubleshooting
===============
You will not be able to view some images if you are low on memory, or if
your TEMP disk drive is full. Check your system configuration and the option
menu, some quantization algorithms require a lot of free memory.
The NOMSSI Viewer shows an error code (Status) when you press F1 in graphics
mode. As for release 1.5, Status 4E0B stand for "Memory Overflow", this is
subject to change without notice.

Other problems:

 o  The information panel shows false color informations for ILBM/HAM and TGA
    color maped files
 o  The bar gauge is not updated correctly on PCX files
 o  Hardware scrolling doesn't work in VGA-mode 320x200 on some chipsets
 o  ET4000 TrueColor modes selection problems (fixed ?)
 o  Disabled video modes are not saved to NV.CFG.
    (work around exist, see manual)
 o  Hardware scrolling in 24 bit modes may shift the colors
 o  The graphics isn't always restored correctly after a help screen from
    graphics mode
 o  soft scrolling with mouse
 o  Weitek P9000 chipset detection problems, use /VESA
 o  Sierra 32K HiColor DAC problems
 o  Cirrus CL542x VESA BIOS version 1.20 has serious bugs.
    Use a newer release.
 o  Floppy disk copy cannot be easily cancelled

NVX
===
NVX is the DOS protected mode port of The NOMSSI Viewer. NVX uses DPMI
(DOS Protected Mode Interface) to run in protected mode which gives the
application access to all your computer's memory. With the exceptions
outlined in NVX!USER.DOC, the DOS protected-mode technology is completely
transparent and no extra steps are necessary in order to run a protected-
mode application.
The performance is improved for large images. The resource file NVX.NVR
must be in the same directory than the executable, or NVX will abort with
"Error in Stream". NVX supports swapping to disk with the /F command line
parameter,
    NVX /F1000000
uses 1,000,000 bytes of the start-up directory as swap file ~NVX.$$$. The
heap viewer in the menubar should report the change.
